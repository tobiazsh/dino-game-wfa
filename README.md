# Dino Game made in WFA

This is the famous Google Dinosaur game made in Windows Forms Application (WFA).
I know that WFA is not the best choice for creating games, but I my teacher wanted us to do so because it is a good way to learn the basics of Windows Forms Application development and generally C# programming.

## How to Play

Use the spacebar to jump over the obstacles.

## Quirks

- The Dinosaur is not animated because of the way I handle textures in-code (using Bitmaps) and I do not find it necessary to build a whole animation system for just a simple assignment. (I was told _specifically NOT_ to overcomplicate it)
- No sound effects because I was not given the resources to implement so.

## Resources - Sources

I was told to download the resources from this link: https://www.mooict.com/c-tutorial-create-a-t-rex-endless-runner-game-in-visual-studio/ and they hence everything in the "Resources" folder falls under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Copied

Most of the game's logic was directly copied from the [Flappy Bird Game](https://github.com/tobiazsh/flappy-birds-wfa) I made earlier - this was an assignment too.
